### Document: Backend Improvements and Roadmap

**1. Project Overview**

The backend is a Node.js application written in TypeScript that serves as a data aggregator for cryptocurrency arbitrage opportunities. It fetches data from multiple exchanges, calculates spreads, and exposes the data through a REST API.

**2. Current State & What's Good**

*   **Clear Architecture:** The project is well-structured with a clear separation of concerns between routes, services, and configuration.
*   **TypeScript:** The use of TypeScript provides type safety and improves code quality.
*   **Caching:** A caching layer is implemented to improve performance and reduce the number of requests to external exchanges.
*   **Configuration:** Exchange configurations are centralized, making it easy to add or modify exchange-specific settings.
*   **Market Type Separation:** The backend correctly distinguishes between `spot` and `perp` markets.

**3. Areas for Improvement**

*   **Code Duplication:**
    *   The `api.ts` and `api-refactored.ts` files have significant overlap. The legacy `api.ts` should be removed.
    *   The `simple-server.js` and `test-server.js` files appear to be for testing or demonstration purposes and should be removed from the main `src` directory.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Error handling is basic. A more robust error handling strategy should be implemented, including custom error classes and a centralized error handling middleware.
*   **Testing:**
    *   There are no unit or integration tests. This makes it difficult to refactor code with confidence.
*   **Logging:**
    *   The current logging is done through `console.log`. A more structured logging library like `winston` or `pino` should be used.
*   **Environment Management:**
    *   The use of `.env.example` is good, but a more robust solution like `dotenv` should be used to manage environment variables.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   The `package.json` file should be reviewed to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and there are no security vulnerabilities.
*   **Build Process:**
    *   A build process should be implemented to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript, which can then be run in production.
*   **Linting and Formatting:**
    *   A linter and formatter (like ESLint and Prettier) should be configured to enforce a consistent code style.

**4. Roadmap**

**Phase 1: Code Cleanup and Consolidation (1-2 weeks)**

*   [ ] Remove `api.ts`, `simple-server.js`, and `test-server.js`.
*   [ ] Consolidate all API logic into `api-refactored.ts`.
*   [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent code style.
*   [ ] Add a `build` script to the `package.json` to compile the TypeScript code.

**Phase 2: Improving Robustness (2-4 weeks)**

*   [ ] Implement a structured logging solution (e.g., `winston`).
*   [ ] Create a robust error handling strategy with custom error classes.
*   [ ] Add unit tests for all services.
*   [ ] Add integration tests for the API endpoints.

**Phase 3: Production Readiness (1-2 weeks)**

*   [ ] Use `dotenv` to manage environment variables.
*   [ ] Review and update all dependencies.
*   [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` for production deployment.
*   [ ] Add a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.

**Phase 4: New Features (Ongoing)**

*   [ ] Add WebSocket support for real-time data updates.
*   [ ] Add more exchanges.
*   [ ] Add a database to store historical data.
